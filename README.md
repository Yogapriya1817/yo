Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Step 2: Set Up IBM Cloud Services
Log in to your IBM Cloud account.

Create a Watson Visual Recognition service. You can do this by navigating to the IBM Cloud Dashboard, clicking "Create Resource," and searching for "Visual Recognition." Follow the setup instructions.

Once your Visual Recognition service is created, note down the service credentials as you will need them to configure the application.

Step 3: Configure the Application
In the repository, locate the config.js file and update it with your Visual Recognition service credentials and any other necessary configuration details.

javascript
Copy code
module.exports = {
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  url: 'your-url',
  version: '2021-03-09', // Update with your service version
};
Step 4: Deploy the Application on IBM Cloud
Install the IBM Cloud CLI tool if you haven't already. You can find installation instructions here.

Log in to IBM Cloud using the CLI:

bash
Copy code
ibmcloud login
Navigate to the root directory of your project and push your application to IBM Cloud:
bash
Copy code
ibmcloud app push
Once the application is successfully deployed, you will receive a URL for your web interface.
Using the Web Interface
The web interface allows users to upload images and get recognition results. You can access it by visiting the URL provided after deploying the application on IBM Cloud.

Open a web browser and go to the provided URL.

Click on the "Upload Image" button to select an image from your local device.

After selecting an image, click the "Recognize" button.

The system will process the image and display the recognition results, including any detected objects or labels.

Updating Content
You can customize the web interface, add more features, or modify the code according to your project requirements. The main code files are located in the src directory. Make your changes and then redeploy the application on IBM Cloud to see the updates.
